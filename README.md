Prompt: At the age of 18 everyone gets teleported into a small room. In front of you is a table with all kinds of meals from apples to gourmet meats. 
Whatever you take a bite of will determine what superpower you'll get. You are the first person to take a bite of the table itself.

Breinleigh walked over to the giant ugly table and said "Omg you're so ugly, I'm going to eat you." She laughed and it was the nasty kind of laugh that makes you think they're not actually laughing, the kind of laugh that sounds like a crusty mummy exhaling after being brought to life. She began knawing on the table and didn't even care when her teeth began bleeding and falling out. After a few minutes of gnawing, she began transforming into Kim Kardashian. Breinleigh looked at herself in a little compaxt mirror with the words "Live, Laugh, Love" engraved into it and shrieked when she realized what had happened. She was wailing about this transformation when she noticed that the table began transforming into her, or at least her old self.

The table had become an exact replica of Breinleigh, all the way up to the missing and bleeding teeth. The whole room was shocked, especially Breinleigh who not only saw herself change into a celebrity, but also saw a formerly inanimate object turn into her former self. Just then, everyone hears a *vloop* from behind them. Breinleigh whips her head around to see an alien with a massive blue forehead floating in a hovercraft above everyone else. Behind him, his sidekick, a metal space-suit with a piranha for a head. The blue alien, as if this wasn't a strange situation, starts to explain to all the 18 year olds that he was holding an experiment and was not planning on someone eating the table. He then tells the students that the table was the real Kim Kardashian all along and eating the table had killed Kim but traded her body with Breinleighs at the same time. Breinleigh had killed Kim Kardashian disguised as a table and stolen her body at the same time without a clue what she was doing!
