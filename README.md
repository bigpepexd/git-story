Prompt: At the age of 18 everyone gets teleported into a small room. In front of you is a table with all kinds of meals from apples to gourmet meats. 
Whatever you take a bite of will determine what superpower you'll get. You are the first person to take a bite of the table itself.

Breinleigh walked over to the giant ugly table and said "Omg you're so ugly, I'm going to eat you." She laughed and it was the nasty kind of laugh that makes you think they're not actually laughing, the kind of laugh that sounds like a crusty mummy exhaling after being brought to life. She began knawing on the table and didn't even care when her teeth began bleeding and falling out. After a few minutes of gnawing, she began transforming into Kim Kardashian. Breinleigh looked at herself in a little compaxt mirror with the words "Live, Laugh, Love" engraved into it and shrieked when she realized what had happened. She was wailing about this transformation when she noticed that the table began transforming into her, or at least her old self.








The table had become an exact replica of Breinleigh, all the way up to the missing and bleeding teeth. The whole room was shocked, especially Breinleigh who not only saw herself change into a celebrity, but also saw a formerly inanimate object turn into her former self. Just then, everyone hears a *vloop* from behind them. Breinleigh whips her head around to see an alien with a massive blue forehead floating in a hovercraft above everyone else. Behind him, his sidekick, a metal space-suit with a piranha for a head. The blue alien, as if this wasn't a strange situation, starts to explain to all the 18 year olds that he was holding an experiment and was not planning on someone eating the table. He then tells the students that the table was the real Kim Kardashian all along and eating the table had killed Kim but traded her body with Breinleighs at the same time. Breinleigh had killed Kim Kardashian disguised as a table and stolen her body at the same time without a clue what she was doing.







Standing next to Breinleigh was Jamal, he couldn't believe what he saw happen to Breinleigh and the table. Jamal grew to like the idea of transforming himself into a handsome man. He took a bite out of what used to be the table and what is now Breinleigh's old self, the earth began spinning within Jamals head. Then poof he was back to himself, well not quite. He looked over at Breinleigh as he was looking for the pocket mirror in her hand. Breinleigh was in shock and couldn't believe what she saw. Jamal grabs the mirror from her hands and takes a look at himself, "OMG IM KANYE WEST" he said with a bit of joy and surpise. 


 





The table began to attack Breinleigh, violently hitting her with a valentino white bag. However, she fought back, using her newfound Kardshian powers. She slashed the table with her nails, whipped with her long pony tail, and bumped with her hips that don't lie. The table was on the floor, knocked out from the impact of Kim hips, and Breinleigh didn't waste any time making a run for the door. She ran out the door and through a very long hallway, going as far as her heels would take her. But the table was on the move, running very quickly to Breinleigh. The table tackled her to the floor with a slam, and like that, Breinleigh was knocked out cold.









They were thrilled about their new transformations and wanted to tell show everyone. The two of them went to their friend judiah's house and knocked on the door. Judiah opened the door and passed out immediately. After Breinleigh and Jamal started smacking Judiah in the face to wake up, he eventually starts to get up. After he gets up he said "Holy toledo boledo foledo! Are you Kanye and Kim? Jamal and Breinleigh looked at each other and laughed, "No Judiah, its Jamal and Breinleigh we ate a table and turned into Kanye and Kim". Judiah looked confused and said "What? How do you turn back to yourself?" Jamal and Breinleigh turned to each other with worry in their eyes. "I don't know" they said. 








Breinleigh woke up in an empty room, tied to a chair. She immediately began to struggle, trying to escape, but couldn't. Then, the door opened, and in walked the table. It silently walked around her, saying nothing. Until suddenly, the table ripped off Breinleigh's diamond earing. She screamed, and went into a giant fit of rage, completely destroying the chair she was tied to. Breinleigh was transforming again, but this time, she grew giant muscles, lost her hair, and was much taller. She had become the Rock. With her newfound power, she began to beat the fork out of the table.








Breingleigh had been transported to Jumanji and took the place of Dr. Smolder Bravestone. The table transformed into a massive wild beast and started gnawing on her arm. She was surprisingly unphased by the monster though and flicked it off with ease. She jumped on a tree, bodyslammed the table and then did the rocks famous smolder. This transformation was too incredible, she had become much stronger. Then she turned around and saw her final foe.
